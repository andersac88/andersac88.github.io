                    <p>My name is Andrew Andersen and I am 30 years old. I currently reside in Arlington Heights with my
                        fiancé, Ashley, our two cats, Maggie and Millie, and our miniature pincher, Mia.</p>
                    <p>I am a graduate of Miami University in Oxford Ohio and went to university with the intention of undertaking
                        a career in medicine though towards the end of my tenure I realized I wasn't destined to be a doctor.</p>
                    <p>Following graduation, still unsure of my purpose, I followed in the footsteps of my father and began
                        working in property management. While this path has afforded my a comfortable lifestyle I find that
                        the field lacks a certain mental stimulation that I desire.</p>
                    <p>Ever eager to learn new things, I am fortunate enough to have come across Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp.
                        Unlike other programs, Northwestern has permitted me to learn a new skill set on a part—time basis.</p>
                    <p>While it would be nice if this class ultimately leads me to a new more fulfilling career, I excited
                        to learn something new.</p>
